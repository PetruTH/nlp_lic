# DexFlex Documentation

DexFlex is a Python package for Romanian language processing.  
It leverages [dexonline](https://github.com/dexonline/dexonline) to extract dictionary data, applies rule-based methods, and integrates **spaCy** with the Romanian model [`ro_core_news_lg`](https://spacy.io/models/ro).  
The library provides functionality such as inflection handling, synonym suggestions, and transformations between tenses and voices.

---

## Installation

DexFlex is available on PyPI:

pip install dexflex

Note: On the first run, a setup script will be executed to fetch and prepare the dictionary data required by DexFlex.
This process may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.

## Features

### ðŸ”¹ Inflection Handling

* For a given target word, extract **all inflectional forms**.

### ðŸ”¹ Tense Transformation

* Automated switching between **past perfect** and **past simple**.

### ðŸ”¹ Synonym Suggestions

* Context-aware synonym generation.

### ðŸ”¹ Voice Transformation

* Convert **active â†’ passive** voice and **passive â†’ active** voice.

---

## Synonym Suggestion Process

Synonym generation is performed in **four steps**:

1. Identify the current contextual meaning of the word
2. Select synonyms that match the sentenceâ€™s meaning
3. Inflect synonyms to match the contextual grammatical form
4. Heuristically sort and return synonyms

### Sorting Criteria

* Length of the word
* Dictionary ordering
* Approximate syllable count
* Similarity with context embeddings
* Frequency

## Usage

### Import

```python
pip install dexflex
```

```python
from dexflex.prototype import *
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("ro_core_news_lg")
```

### Example 1: Inflection Handling

```python
data_aif = [
    ("ocol", 0),
    ("Rece, crudÄƒ, geloasÄƒ pe frumuseÈ›ea È™i È™armul CenuÈ™Äƒresei,", 2),
    ("Ea era hotÄƒrÃ¢tÄƒ sÄƒ susÈ›inÄƒ interesele propriilor sale fiice.", 0),
    ("Castelul a ajuns o ruinÄƒ.", 0),
]

for sample in data_aif:
    doc = nlp(sample[0])
    all_forms_for_word = get_all_forms(doc[sample[1]])

    print(f"For target-word: {doc[sample[1]]} there are all the inflected forms:")
    for form in all_forms_for_word:
        print(form)
    print("\n\n")
```

---

### Example 2: Synonym Suggestions

```python
samples = [
    ("Am observat eroarea la timp.", 2),
    ("Ea a Ã®nvÄƒÈ›at sÄƒ cÃ¢nte la pian.", 4),
    ("Am observat eroarea la timp.", 1),
    ("Ei au reparat maÈ™ina stricatÄƒ.", -2),
    ("Tu ai scris o poezie frumoasÄƒ.", -2),
    ("Ea s-a gÄƒtit pentru o cinÄƒ delicioasÄƒ.", 3),
    ("El a uitat sÄƒ aducÄƒ documentele.", -2),
    ("Ea a primit un cadou de ziua ei.", 4),
    ("Tu ai vorbit cu profesorul?", -2),
    ("Ei au construit un parc nou.", 2),
    ("El a plecat la camera lui.", -3)
]

for sample in samples:
    doc = nlp(sample[0])
    syn_list = [syn[0] for syn in doc[sample[1]]._.get_syns()]
    print(f"Synonyms for: {doc[sample[1]]} are {syn_list}")
```

## Additional Notes

* DexFlex uses **dexonline data**, transformed into JSON files for efficient lookups.
* Example contexts are stored as **embeddings in `.feather` format** for better memory handling.
* A working **demo** is provided in [`demo.ipynb`](demo.ipynb).
